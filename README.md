## User Story
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.

# Screenshot of website

# Technologies used
This project used node.js with various packages including inquirer and axios. To make the webpage and pdf it used HTML, CSS (using bootstrap for layout and mobile readiness), javascript and jQuery. It also utilized a 3rd party API from github.

# Acknowledgements
